# wsp_tools
This repository contains a mixture of packages, scripts, and notebooks that have been useful in my work in the McMorran lab.

## Installation
``````Bash
pip install git+https://github.com/McMorranLab/wsp_tools
```

## Contents
The contents are continually being updated, but are in general divided into two
sections: `wsp_tools`, a package with useful optics functions, and everything
else - mostly scripts and/or jupyter notebooks.
