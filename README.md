# wsp_tools
wsp_tools contains utilities for TEM data analysis and presentation.

Features:

* Single Image TIE
* Lorentz simulations
* spatial mode implementations
* a matplotlib.pyplot wrapper
* an implementation of the cielab colorspace
* a scipy.constants wrapper that allows unit scaling (i.e., using nanometers instead of meters)

## Installation
```Bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/McMorranLab/wsp_tools#egg=wsp-tools
```

Installing in editable mode `-e` ensures that pip records the install url, with the correct commit.

## Documentation

As of version 1.0.94, wsp_tools includes a helper function `docs(outdir=".")`, which uses ```pdoc3``` to auto-generate html documentation and save it to an outdir of your choice, thus avoiding the need to clone this repository just to see the documentation. For example:

```Python
import wsp_tools
wsp_tools.docs("~/Desktop") # generates docs in the folder ~/Desktop/wsp_tools
```

Documentation is auto-generated by ```pdoc``` and is included in two forms:

1. [A single markdown file](docs/docsmd/docs.md) (for readability on GitHub)
2. [As html](docs/wsp_tools/index.html) (easier to navigate, but you have to clone the repository to render them).

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/McMorranLab/wsp_tools
open wsp_tools/docs/wsp_tools/index.html
```
